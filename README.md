# Loan-Default-Risk-Analysis
(Excel Case Study)

# Overview
This project explores borrower-level loan data from a fictional financial company to uncover patterns linked to high default rates. The aim was to support more informed loan approvals and reduce financial risk â€” using Excel as the primary tool.

# Business Problem
The company faced rising customer defaults due to weak borrower screening. This resulted in cash flow issues and profit loss. The goal was to identify risky borrower profiles and provide actionable recommendations for smarter lending decisions.

# Objectives & Key Questions
- What borrower characteristics are most common among defaulted loans?
- How do income level, interest rates, and loan amounts relate to default rates?
- Which loan grades and sub-grades carry the highest risk?

# Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel  
- Power Query (for transformation)  
- Pivot Tables, Binning, Percentage Analysis

# Key Insights
- Loan grades B, C, and D showed the highest concentration of defaults.
- Interest rates above 13% had an 80%+ default rate.
- Loan amounts exceeding PKR 10,000 sharply increased default likelihood.
- Income and employment length were not strong standalone predictors.

# Strategic Recommendations
- Reassess approval thresholds for mid-tier loan grades.
- Cap or stress-test high-interest loans before approval.
- Combine multiple borrower metrics for more accurate risk profiling.
